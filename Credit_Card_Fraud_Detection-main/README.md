# Credit Card Fraud Detection System

The Credit Card Fraud Detection System is a machine learning-based solution designed to identify and prevent fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time. The project involves building predictive models by analyzing historical transaction data that includes both legitimate and fraudulent records. The objective is to develop a system that can accurately classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine, ensuring financial safety and reducing the risk of losses.

To achieve this, the system applies supervised learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Isolation Forest, along with techniques like data preprocessing, feature selection, and handling class imbalance using SMOTE or undersampling. The primary goal is to maximize fraud detection rate (recall) while minimizing false positives, ensuring that legitimate transactions are not mistakenly flagged.
